# Please note:

Location of the  **novxlib**  library: https://github.com/peter88213/novxlib
Location of the **aeon2nvlib** library: https://github.com/peter88213/aeon2nv

It is advised to clone these projects at the same directory level as the  *novelyst_aeon2*  project and set a project reference to it. So the build scripts can generate the  *novelyst_aeon2*  plugin.
